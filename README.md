# Radiological-pollution-monitoring-anomaly-detection
This project focuses on continuous monitoring of radiological pollution using gamma photon counting sensors. The main objective is to apply unsupervised learning methods to analyze unlabeled datasets. The goal is to detect and flag anomalies as new samples arrive in the time series data.
